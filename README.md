# Regular-Hexagon

A junior-year Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles class project to test new knowledge of arrays. 
Essentially, an array will hold six coordinate points that represent the vertices of a RegularHexagon. 
Now, the coordinate point objects are in consecutive order. That is, if you connect the element at index 0 
with the element at index 1 and so on to the element at index 5 and then back to 0, a hexagon will be formed.
